**Result Analysis**

Train Loss:
The average train loss across all categories is approximately 0.4228. This indicates the overall performance of the model during training.

Validation Loss:
The average validation loss is approximately 0.375, which is lower than the average train loss. This suggests that the model may be slightly overfitting during training.

Validation Accuracy:
The average validation accuracy is 0.375. This metric indicates the overall performance of the model on unseen data.

Category Analysis:
Top k: This category has the highest average train loss (0.4423) and the highest validation loss (0.4000). The validation accuracy is 0.4. Bottom k: This category has a slightly lower average train loss (0.4256) compared to the top k, and the validation loss is lower (0.3000). The validation accuracy is 0.3. Odd: This category has a lower average train loss (0.4140) compared to the top k and bottom k, and the validation loss is 0.3. The validation accuracy is 0.3. Even: This category has the lowest average train loss (0.4094), but it has the highest validation loss (0.5000) among all categories. The validation accuracy is the highest among all categories at 0.5.

Overall Analysis:
The model seems to perform better on even epochs based on validation accuracy, although it has the highest validation loss. There might be some overfitting issues as the validation loss is generally lower than the training loss, which could suggest that the model is memorizing the training data rather than learning generalizable patterns. Further analysis and tuning may be required to improve the model's performance, such as regularization techniques or adjusting the model architecture.
